# Primer Designer Project

## Project Description:

In this project I will build a python script that will eventually take user inputed nucleotide sequence for a gene of interest and design primers for cloning that gene. The user will be able to add restriction factor sites to the primers to aid in cloning.  The user will also be able to indicate if they wish to insert mutations in the gene using overlapping PCR and the script will design primers for inserting the selected mutation by overlapping PCR.

## Project Goals:

1. Design a python script that will design 5' and 3' primers for an inputed nucleotide sequence
2. Include the ability to add restriction factor sites to the primer designer script
3. Add a python script that will design primers for specifically mutating the gene using overlapping PCR
